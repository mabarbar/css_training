# css_training

<h1>Welcome! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>It is another study but this time about css. Just studying, it shows my progress through webdev.</p>
<p>I've learned about Cascading Style Sheets: elements; list of directives- selectors, properties and their values (declarations); typography; hypertext and list styles<p>
<h2>Feel free to check my other projects ðŸ“œ</h2>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
